## by Hussam Mohamed Ali Elzaphry


## Dataset

> Ford gobike dataset is a one month of collective data from bike users in San Fransisco.
> time and date segregation have been extracted from the records.
> Some null values have been analysed and dropped.
> Some filters were applied to highlight the data without fliers data


## Summary of Findings

> Most of the service users are subscribed users.
> Males make more trips than females. may be they'd be targeted in marketing campaigns, especially when noticing that;
> Females tend to spend more time on their trips.
> Unspecified users (gender unknown) and missing data like birth year, may refer to inconvenient regestration process, knowing that gender "Others" tend spend significant time on their trips.
> Most of the service users are born between 82, and 94
> However, people from other birth years spend signifcant time in their trip durations, back to the year of 1940.
> Most trips are at the time of 8 am, and 5 pm
> Also, most of trips are on Thursday
> Most popular starting and ending stations are: San Francisco Caltrain Station 2, and Market St at 10th St, which we can use to enhance the service targeting dense stations at crowd times with more bikes.

## Key Insights

> Many findings referes that there might be a significant issue in regestration process, due to the missing data or customers who user the service anunmously.
> It seems too that females are not targeted enough with the marketing campaigns, even though the female users spend more time using the service.
> from the dense times and stations, a different bike supply strategy could be applied to compansate the heavy usage
> Data validation needs more attention to the regstration process due to many meaningless in users birth year
